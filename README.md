# TournamentMaker
It's a all in one tournament maker

This is mainly 3 - 4 players tournaments of Double eliminations, or single. you choose the names, how many are playing and eventually ill be adding a AWBW version, and may even consider doing custom random map generators for other games, or let you import your own map lists. Idk what ill do yet, so leave suggestions.
